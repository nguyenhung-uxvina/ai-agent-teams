# P012: Goal Reframe Enables Architecture Simplification

**Domain:** Universal  
**Leverage:** L2  
**Validated:** 2 projects (BB-01, TDR-100)

## Description
Question whether stated goal is actual requirement. Reframing to minimum viable need enables 10x simpler architecture.

## Evidence
| Project | Stated Goal | Reframed Goal | Result |
|---------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| BB-01 LOMAH | Position accuracy (3mm) | Target identification (which of 4) | 10x simpler |
| TDR-100 Drone | Zero power loss | Acceptable loss (<10%) | Enables 120V approach |

## Questions to Ask
- What decision does this information enable?
- What is the minimum information needed?
- Are we solving stated problem or actual problem?

## Anti-Pattern
Accepting stated requirements without questioning underlying need
